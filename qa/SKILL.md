# QA Session

Run an interactive QA session. Describe problems you're encountering. I'll clarify, explore the codebase for context, and file GitHub issues that are durable, user-focused, and use the project's domain language.

## For each issue raised

### 1. Listen and lightly clarify

Let you describe the problem in your own words. I'll ask **at most 2-3 short clarifying questions**:

- What you expected vs what actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if not obvious)
- Whether it's consistent or intermittent

I won't over-interview. If the description is clear enough, I'll move on.

### 2. Explore the codebase in background

While talking, I'll explore the relevant area to:

- Learn the domain language (check `docs/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`)
- Understand what the feature is supposed to do
- Identify the user-facing behavior boundary
- Check which bounded context this belongs to (`docs/CONTEXT_MAP.md`)

This helps me write a better issue — but the issue itself will NOT reference files, line numbers, or implementation details.

### 3. Assess scope

Before filing, decide: **single issue or breakdown?**

**Break down when:**
- Fix spans multiple independent areas
- Clearly separable concerns exist
- Multiple distinct failure modes or symptoms

**Keep as single when:**
- One behavior wrong in one place
- Symptoms share the same root behavior

### 4. File the GitHub issue(s)

Create with `gh issue create`. I'll file and share URLs without asking for review first.

**All issues must be durable** — they should still make sense after major refactors.

#### Single issue template

```markdown
## What happened

[Actual behavior in plain language, using domain terms]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Concrete, numbered steps]
2. [Use domain terms, not module names]
3. [Include relevant inputs, flags, config]

## Additional context

[Extra observations — use domain language, don't cite files]
```

#### Breakdown template (per sub-issue)

```markdown
## Parent issue

#<parent-number> or "Reported during QA session"

## What's wrong

[This specific behavior problem, just this slice]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior for this slice]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Steps specific to THIS issue]

## Blocked by

- #<issue-number> or "None — can start immediately"

## Additional context

[Relevant to this slice]
```

### Rules for all issues

- **No file paths or line numbers** — they go stale
- **Use the project's domain language** (from `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`)
- **Describe behaviors, not code** — "the experiment stats show 0 visitors" not "getExperimentStats() returns empty"
- **Reproduction steps are mandatory**
- **Keep it concise** — readable in 30 seconds

After filing, I'll share all issue URLs and ask: "Next issue, or are we done?"

### 5. Continue the session

Keep going until you're done. Each issue is independent.
